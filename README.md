This Java code represents a simple banking system with functionalities for user registration, login, viewing account details, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds.

Here's a breakdown of the main components:

User Class: Defines a class representing a user with attributes such as name, address, contact information, and balance. It has getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying these attributes.

BankingSystem Class: Contains the main logic for the banking system. It includes methods for user registration, login, and various banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer.

Map<Integer, User> users: This map is used to store user objects with their corresponding account numbers as keys.

registerUser() Method: Prompts the user to enter their details such as name, address, contact information, and initial deposit amount. It generates a unique account number for the user and stores the user details in the map.

loginUser() Method: Allows existing users to log in by providing their account number. It retrieves the user details from the map based on the provided account number.

showMenu() Method: Displays a menu of account management options for the logged-in user, such as viewing account details, depositing, withdrawing, transferring funds, and logging out.

viewAccountDetails(), deposit(), withdraw(), transferFunds() Methods: Implement functionalities for viewing account details, depositing money into the account, withdrawing money from the account, and transferring funds to another user's account, respectively.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for a banking system with essential functionalities. However, in a real-world scenario, additional features such as transaction history, authentication mechanisms, error handling, and security measures would need to be implemented for a fully functional and secure banking system.
